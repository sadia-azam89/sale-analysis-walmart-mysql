About**

This project involves analyzing Walmart sales data to gain insights into the performance of different branches and products. The goal is to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and identify areas where sales strategies can be enhanced. The dataset used is from a Kaggle competition focused on Walmart Sales Forecasting and the link is https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting , where historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores with various departments is provided. The challenge is to predict the sales for each department in each store, taking into account specific holiday markdown events that impact sales but are challenging to predict in terms of their influence on different departments and the overall extent of the impact.

This analysis focuses on three key areas: Product Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Customer Analysis. The aim is to provide actionable insights for improving sales strategies and optimizing business operations.
